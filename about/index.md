**No Legacy \|\| Literatura electrónica**

"Literary history is a lie." Ortega and Saum, *100 Truths and One Red Herring.* Antología del mito, 2032

Imagine a world where things were completely unrelated. A world where nothing was connected to anything. A social network where users existed in complete isolation. A family where ties were irrelevant. An artistic tradition where works sprung out of nothing. A science without cause and effect. A language where “influence” was defined as “spontaneous combustion.”

A literary history without intertextuality.

No Legacy is not this.
But it could be.

**No Legacy \|\| Literatura Electrónica** is a provocation.

**No Legacy** is a radical critique of the history of literature through a reflection on recursive temporalities. With no linear history, all literature is contemporary in No Legacy’s archaeology.

**No Legacy** questions the languages of literature. Poetics bypass words. In No Legacy ideas take any form or are represented by just the one. In No Legacy, ideas are not means to explain the world around us. Rather, they are the objects that comprise the No Legacy world. In this ecosystem the literary is but an idea enacted across language, media, and time.

**No Legacy** challenges your learned definitions. It proposes a universe of likely knowledge, rather than the absolute.

Literature not bound by words or media.

Ever-present ideas. Contemporary past.

**No Legacy** is material discourse for literary archaeology.
